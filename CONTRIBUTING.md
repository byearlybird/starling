# Contributing to Starling

Thanks for helping improve Starling! This document captures the basics for checking out the repo, running tests, and keeping docs/code consistent.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.0+ (used for scripts, builds, and tests)
- Node.js 18+ (for editor tooling, though Bun drives most commands)

Install dependencies from the workspace root:

```bash
bun install
```

## Repository Structure

For a detailed overview of the repository layout, architecture, eventstamps, CRDT-like merging, and module organization, see [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).

For a record of project-wide decisions, see the [Architecture Decision Log](docs/decision-log.md).

## Running Tests

```bash
bun test

# Watch mode
bun test --watch

# Specific test file
bun test packages/core/src/store/store.test.ts
```

- The `core` suite exercises every CRDT primitive; run it whenever you touch merge logic, transaction behavior, or store hooks.
- When changing / creating plugins, add scenario-specific tests (e.g., using Bun's `test()` runner) in the same directory as the plugin.

## Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Check code
bun biome check .

# Format code
bun biome format --write .

# Lint code
bun biome lint .
```

## Builds

```bash
# Build core package (includes plugin entrypoints)
bun run build:core
```

Use `bun run build:all` at the workspace root to build every package in sequence.

## Version Bumps

To prepare a package for release, bump its version from inside the package directory:

```bash
cd packages/core
bun pm version patch    # Bump patch version
bun pm version minor    # Bump minor version
bun pm version major    # Bump major version
```

Publishing to npm is restricted to project maintainers.

## Documentation

- Keep README sections focused on user-facing workflows. Implementation details, changelogs, and contributor tips belong here or in package-specific docs.
- Update the plugin docs in `docs/plugins/*` when you add new options or operational details so consumers can discover them without diving into code.

### JSDoc Guidelines

To avoid duplication between JSDoc and markdown docs, follow these principles:

**JSDoc is for code context** - Brief explanations visible in IDEs while writing code:
- What does this parameter do?
- What's a minimal usage example?
- Any immediate gotchas?

**Markdown is for learning** - Conceptual explanations and tutorials:
- Why this design choice?
- How does it work internally?
- When to use what?

**Keep JSDoc minimal and usage-focused**:

✅ **Good** (terse, shows usage):
```typescript
/**
 * Merge a remote collection using field-level LWW.
 * @param collection - Collection from storage or another replica
 */
merge(collection: Collection): void { ... }
```

❌ **Bad** (duplicates architecture docs):
```typescript
/**
 * Merge a remote collection using field-level Last-Write-Wins.
 *
 * The merge operation:
 * 1. Forwards the clock to the newest eventstamp
 * 2. Merges each document using field-level LWW
 * ...15 more lines explaining the algorithm...
 */
merge(collection: Collection): void { ... }
```

**What to include in JSDoc**:
- Type descriptions for exported types
- Parameter descriptions when not obvious from TypeScript
- Short (1-3 line) usage examples
- Links to markdown docs for complex topics: `@see docs/architecture.md#merging`

**What to keep only in markdown**:
- Architecture explanations (how eventstamps work, why LWW)
- Design rationale (decision log items)
- Multi-step tutorials
- "When to use" guidance

**Target**: Each JSDoc comment should be under 5 lines (excluding examples). If you need more, link to markdown docs instead.

## Pull Request Checklist
