# Starling Architecture

Status: Draft

This document covers the design and internals of Starling, including the state-based Last-Write-Wins merge strategy, eventstamps, the plugin system, and module organization.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core` | Core store implementation (`Store`, `Document`, `Eventstamp`, `Record`, `Value`, `KV`, `Clock`) plus unit tests |
| `packages/core/src/plugins/query` | Reactive query plugin that filters and tracks store changes |
| `packages/core/src/plugins/unstorage` | Persistence plugin that hydrates on boot and debounces writes |

**Key points:**

- Core logic lives under `packages/core`; official plugins are co-located in `packages/core/src/plugins/*`
- All packages are TypeScript modules bundled via `tsdown`
- Tests live alongside implementation: `packages/core/src/**/*.test.ts`

## Eventstamps

Eventstamps power Starling's conflict resolution. Each value is stamped with:

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ|hexCounter|hexNonce
```

Example: `2025-10-26T10:00:00.000Z|0001|a7f2`

### How They Work

**Monotonic ordering**: The hex counter increments whenever the OS clock stalls (same millisecond) or goes backward. The nonce is a random 4-character hex value that serves as a final tie-breaker, ensuring every write gets a unique, sortable stamp even when timestamp and counter are identical.

**Clock forwarding**: When a client receives a remote eventstamp newer than its local clock, it fast-forwards to that time. This keeps clocks loosely synchronized across devices without requiring a time server.

**Last-Write-Wins**: During merge, the field with the higher eventstamp wins. If Client A writes `name: "Alice"` at `T1` and Client B writes `name: "Bob"` at `T2`, Bob's value persists because `T2 > T1`.

### Design Characteristics

This approach provides predictable, deterministic merging:

**Automatic conflict resolution**: No merge callbacks or conflict detection needed—the newest write always wins. This makes reasoning about state simple and keeps the mental model lightweight.

**Self-synchronizing clocks**: When devices observe newer remote eventstamps, they fast-forward their local clocks. This loosely synchronizes devices without requiring a time server or coordination protocol.

**Graceful clock handling**: The hex counter ensures monotonicity even when system clocks stall, drift backward, or multiple writes happen in the same millisecond.

**Boundaries to consider:**

For apps where devices sync regularly (personal tools, small teams), wall-clock-based ordering works well. However:

- **Clock skew influences merge outcomes**: A device with a clock running ahead will have its writes prevail over logically newer writes from devices with accurate clocks. In practice, modern devices maintain reasonable clock accuracy via NTP.

- **No explicit causality**: Starling tracks time-based ordering but doesn't capture "happened-before" relationships. Concurrent edits rely on timestamp comparison rather than causal dependencies.

- **Requires eventstamp persistence**: Devices must save the highest eventstamp they've seen to prevent clock regression after restarts. The `unstorage` plugin handles this automatically.

## State-Based Merging

Starling uses **state-based replication**: it syncs full document snapshots, not operation logs. When merging states, Starling compares eventstamps at the field level:

```typescript
// Client A's state
{ 
  name: ["Alice", "2025-10-26T10:00:00.000Z|00000001"],
  email: ["alice@old.com", "2025-10-26T10:00:00.000Z|00000001"]
}

// Client B's state (newer eventstamp for email only)
{ 
  email: ["alice@new.com", "2025-10-26T10:05:00.000Z|00000001"]
}

// Merged result: email wins due to higher eventstamp, name preserved from Client A
{ 
  name: ["Alice", "2025-10-26T10:00:00.000Z|00000001"],
  email: ["alice@new.com", "2025-10-26T10:05:00.000Z|00000001"]
}
```

**Why state-based?**

State-based replication keeps the implementation focused and efficient:

- **Simple to reason about**: Syncing is just "send current state, merge on arrival"—no operation logs to manage
- **Small codebase**: Eliminates transformation functions, causality tracking, and replay logic
- **Merge idempotency**: Applying the same state multiple times produces the same result—natural retry safety
- **Works everywhere**: Any transport that can move JSON works—HTTP, WebSocket, filesystem, USB stick

**Current implementation**: Starling ships entire snapshots over the wire. Near-term work focuses on delta compression to send only changed fields while maintaining the state-based model.

### Merge Behavior

**Primitives and objects**: Merge recursively at the field level. Each nested field carries its own eventstamp, enabling fine-grained conflict resolution:

```typescript
// Both clients edit different fields simultaneously
Client A: { name: "Alice Smith" }  // Updates name
Client B: { email: "alice@new.com" }  // Updates email

// Both changes preserved
Merged: { name: "Alice Smith", email: "alice@new.com" }
```

**Arrays**: Treated as atomic values—the entire array is replaced rather than merged element-by-element. This provides predictable behavior and avoids ambiguous merge scenarios. For collections that need concurrent edits, use keyed records:

```typescript
// Array (atomic replacement)
{ tags: ["work", "urgent"] }  // Entire array wins/loses as a unit

// Keyed record (field-level merging)
{ todos: { "id1": { text: "..." }, "id2": { text: "..." } } }  // Each todo merges independently
```

**Deletions**: Soft-deleted via `~deletedAt` eventstamp. Deleted documents remain in the snapshot, enabling restoration by writing newer eventstamps to their fields. This also ensures deletion events propagate correctly during sync.

## Design Scope

Starling focuses on the 80/20 of sync for personal and small-team apps:

**What Starling provides:**

- **Automatic convergence**: Field-level Last-Write-Wins ensures all replicas eventually agree
- **Simple mental model**: "Newest write wins" is easy to explain and reason about
- **Embeddable**: Tiny footprint (~4KB core) with zero required dependencies
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works with React, SolidJS, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript

**Specialized use cases:**

For real-time collaboration, strict causal ordering, or complex operational transforms, consider specialized libraries:

- **Collaborative text editing**: [Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev/) or [Diamond Types](https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types) provide mergeable text CRDTs
- **Rich document collaboration**: [Automerge](https://automerge.org/) offers a full CRDT suite with causal consistency
- **Distributed systems with high clock skew**: Vector clock-based systems like [Riak](https://riak.com/) handle multi-datacenter scenarios

Starling can complement these tools—use it for application state while delegating collaborative data structures to specialized CRDTs.

## Plugin System

Stores are extensible via plugins that provide lifecycle hooks and optional methods:

```typescript
type Plugin<T, M extends PluginMethods = {}> = {
  hooks: {
    onInit: (store: Store<T>) => Promise<void> | void;
    onDispose: () => Promise<void> | void;
    onAdd?: (entries: ReadonlyArray<readonly [string, T]>) => void;
    onUpdate?: (entries: ReadonlyArray<readonly [string, T]>) => void;
    onDelete?: (keys: ReadonlyArray<string>) => void;
  };
  methods?: M;
};
```

### Hook Execution

Plugins tap into the store lifecycle at specific points:

- **`onInit`**: Setup phase during `store.init()` (hydrate snapshots, start pollers, establish connections)
- **`onDispose`**: Cleanup phase during `store.dispose()` (flush pending work, close connections)
- **Mutation hooks** (`onAdd`, `onUpdate`, `onDelete`): React to changes after transactions commit, receiving batched entries by mutation type

Mutation hooks are **optional**—implement only what your plugin needs. For example, a read-only analytics plugin might only use `onInit` and `onAdd`.

### Plugin Methods

Plugins can extend the store API by returning methods:

```typescript
const queryPlugin = <T>(): Plugin<T, { query: (opts) => Query<T> }> => ({
  hooks: { /* ... */ },
  methods: {
    query: (opts) => { /* implementation */ }
  }
});

// Usage
const store = await createStore<T>()
  .use(queryPlugin())
  .init();

store.query({ where: (doc) => doc.active }); // Method added by plugin
```

### Plugin Composition

Plugins stack cleanly—each operates independently:

```typescript
const store = await createStore<Todo>()
  .use(queryPlugin())
  .use(unstoragePlugin("todos", localStorageBackend))
  .use(unstoragePlugin("todos", httpBackend, { pollIntervalMs: 5000 }))
  .init();
```

**Execution order:**
1. `onInit` hooks run sequentially (first registered, first executed)
2. Mutation hooks run sequentially after each transaction commits
3. `onDispose` hooks run sequentially during teardown

## Module Overview

Each module handles a distinct responsibility in the state-based replication model:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`clock.ts`](../packages/core/src/clock.ts) | Monotonic logical clock that increments a hex counter when the OS clock stalls, generates random nonces for tie-breaking, and forwards itself when observing newer remote stamps |
| [`eventstamp.ts`](../packages/core/src/eventstamp.ts) | Encoder/decoder for sortable `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ\|counter\|nonce` strings |
| [`value.ts`](../packages/core/src/value.ts) | Wraps primitives with eventstamps and merges values by comparing stamps |
| [`record.ts`](../packages/core/src/record.ts) | Recursively encodes/decodes nested objects, merging each field independently |
| [`document.ts`](../packages/core/src/document.ts) | Attaches system metadata (`~id`, `~deletedAt`) and handles soft-deletion |
| [`kv.ts`](../packages/core/src/kv.ts) | Immutable map with transactional staging for atomic commits |
| [`store.ts`](../packages/core/src/store.ts) | User-facing API, plugin orchestration, and transaction management |

### Data Flow

```
User mutation → Store → KV staging → Transaction commit → Plugin hooks
                                    ↓
                            Eventstamp application
                                    ↓
                            Document/Record/Value merge
```

## Package Exports

Starling ships as a monorepo with subpath exports:

### `@byearlybird/starling` (Core)

**Exports**: `createStore`, `Store`, `Plugin`, `PluginHooks`, `PluginMethods`, `EncodedDocument`  
**Dependencies**: Zero runtime dependencies

Provides the core store implementation and plugin system.

### `@byearlybird/starling/plugin-query`

**Exports**: `queryPlugin`  
**Dependencies**: None (uses core hooks)

Reactive filtered views that re-evaluate when matching documents change.

### `@byearlybird/starling/plugin-unstorage`

**Exports**: `unstoragePlugin`  
**Peer dependency**: `unstorage@^1.17.1`

Persistence layer supporting any `unstorage` backend (localStorage, HTTP, filesystem, etc.). Automatically persists the latest eventstamp to prevent clock regression.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Cover core modules (`clock`, `eventstamp`, `value`, `record`, `document`, `kv`, `store`)
- **Integration tests**: Verify plugin hooks fire correctly and multi-plugin composition works
- **Property-based tests**: Validate eventstamp monotonicity and merge commutativity

Tests live alongside implementation: `packages/core/src/**/*.test.ts`
